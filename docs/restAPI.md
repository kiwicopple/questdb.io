The QuestDB REST API is based around standard HTTP features and is understood by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. 
It provides a simple way to interact with QuestDB and is compatible with most programming languages. 
API functions are fully keyed on the URL and they use query parameters as their arguments. 
Responses are function specific, for example you can download query results as CSV files, 
directly from the API. You can also get JSON responses.

The REST API can be accessed interactively using Web Console that is a part of QuestDB distribution.
Find out more in the section **[using the web console](usingWebConsole.md)**.

>Other machines on your network can access the console or connect to the DB on
  `http://IP_OF_THE_HOST_MACHINE:9000`

>All strings need to be passed as url-encoded, for example by using `--data-urlencode`

## Available methods 
- [`/imp` to load data](#imp---loading-data)
- [`/exec` to query data](#exec---querying-data)
- [`/exp`  to export data](#exp---export-data)
- `/chk`

## /imp - Loading data
The function `/imp` streams tabular text data directly into a table.
It supports CSV, TAB and Pipe (`|`) delimited inputs and optional headers. There are no restrictions on
data size. Data type and structure is detected automatically and usually without additional configuration.
However in some cases additional configuration can be provided to augment automatic detection results.


> The structure detection algorithm analyses the chunk in the beginning and relies on relative uniformity 
> of data. When the first chunk is non-representative of the rest of the data, automatic imports can yield errors.


`/imp` column names from header row as table columns. The following characters are removed from column names:

~~~ java
     [space] _  ?  .  ,  \  \  \\  /  \0  :  )  (  +  -  *  %  ~
~~~

When a header row is missing, column names are generated automatically.

### Syntax
`/imp` requests are HTTP POST, multipart requests. they accept a mixture of form and query arguments:

<table class="alt tall">
<thead>
<th>Argument</th>
<th>Remarks</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="param"><code>schema</code> (optional, form)</td>
<td>

Type hints passed as a JSON object as follows
<p><code>schema='[{"name":"columnName1", "type": "TYPE1"},{"name":"columnName2", "type":"TYPE2"},{...}]'</code></p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="param"><code>data</code> (required, form)</td>
<td>Data to stream. If target table name is not explicitly specified, file
name will be used. Request will fail if file name is also missing.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="param"><code>name</code> (optional, query)</td>
<td>
Name of target table. This parameter takes precedence over file name.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="param"><code>overwrite</code> (optional, query)</td>
<td>
Boolean flag. Default value is <code>false</code>. Set it to <code>true</code> to have existing table
deleted before appending data.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="param"><code>fmt</code> (optional, query)</td>
<td>
Acceptable value is <code>json</code> to have JSON response. Human readable text response otherwise.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="param"><code>durable</code> (optional, query, boolean)</td>
<td>
When request is <durable>durable</durable> QuestDB will flush relevant disk cache before responding. Default value is <code>false</code>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="param"><code>atomicity</code> (optional, query)</td>
<td>
Available values are <code>strict</code> and <code>relaxed</code>. Default value is <code>relaxed</code>. When atomicity is <code>relaxed</code>
data rows that cannot be appended to table are discarded, thus allowing partial uploads. In <code>strict</code> mode upload fails as soon as any
data error is encountered and all previously appended rows are rolled back. There is additional server parameter <code>http.abort.broken.uploads</code>
that governs if server will continue to receive all of the data to completion or close socket right away

<p>
When server is configured to obey HTTP protocol and receive incoming data even though it knows data is useless, it will be doing so with
reduced amount of data processing. It will be parsing multipart data because it has to, but delimited file will not be parsed,
speeding up the process.
</p>

<p>When <code>http.abort.broken.uploads</code> is set to <code>true</code> server will close socket as soon as it detects data error. This
usually forces clients to stop sending data, saves waiting time and frees up server resources immediately. The downside is that some HTTP
clients will not receive diagnostic message, even though server does send it in all cases.
</p>

### ACID Compliance
`/imp` is fully ACID compliant, although Atomicity and Durability can be relaxed to meet convenience
and performance demands.

**Atomicity** is fully insured against any connection problems. If server detects closed socket the entire
request is rolled back instantly and transparently for any existing readers. The only time data can be partially
imported is when atomicity is in <code>relaxed</code> mode and data cannot be converted to column type. 
In this scenario "defective" row of data is discarded and <code>/imp</code> continues to stream request data into table.

**Consistency** is guaranteed by consistency of append transactions against QuestDB storage engine.

**Isolation** Data is committed to QuestDB storage engine at end of request. Uncommitted transactions are not
visible to readers.

**Durability** `/imp` streams data from network socket buffer directly into memory mapped files. At this point
data is handed over to the OS and is resilient against QuestDB internal errors and unlikely but hypothetically possible
crashes. This is default method of appending data and it is chosen for its performance characteristics. In cases where
transaction has to be resilient against OS errors or power losses physical durability can be enforced. At a cost of
append performance QuestDB storage engine will also guarantee that each memory block is flushed to physical device.

### Examples
The following examples upload ratings.csv, which can be found [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
Response shows table name, columns, types, error count in each column and total rows.
When column types are correct error count must be zero. 

### Basic import
```shell script
curl -i -F data=@ratings.csv http://localhost:9000/imp
```

### Import with schema
This example overrides types of `userId` and `movieId` by including `schema` parameter. Schema is passed as a `JSON object`.

```shell script 
curl -i \
-F schema='[{"name":"userId", "type": "STRING"},{"name":"movieId", "type":"STRING"}]' \
-F data=@ratings.csv \
http://localhost:9000/imp

>If the table already exists its structure will take precedence over all but DATE schema fields.

### Import with several parameters
This example shows the concatenation of several import parameters
```shell script
curl -i \
-F data=@ratings.csv \
'http://localhost:9000/imp?forceHeaders=true&overwrite=true'
```

## /exec - Querying Data

`/exec` compiles and executes the SQL query supplied as an argument and returns a JSON object with
either data or an error. The **error object** contains message and position in query text. Position is a number of 
characters from beginning of query where error occurred.

The result of a successful execution is a **JSON object** containing an array of data rows. Each data row is array of column values. 
The dataset metadata is returned in `columns` field - list of column names and their types.

Query execution terminates automatically when the socket connection is closed.

### Syntax
`/exec` is HTTP GET request with following query arguments:

<table class="alt tall">
<thead>
<th>Argument</th>
<th>Remarks</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="param"><code>query</code> (required)</td>
<td>
URL-encoded query text. It can be multi-line, but query separator, such as <code>;</code> must not be included.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="param"><code>limit</code> (optional)</td>
<td>
This argument is used for paging. Limit can be either in format of <code>X,Y</code> where <code>X</code> is the lower 
limit and <code>Y</code> is the upper, or just <code>Y</code>. For example, <code>limit=10,20</code> will return row numbers 10 thru to 20 inclusive.
and <code>limit=20</code> will return first 20 rows, which is equivalent to <code>limit=0,20</code>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="param"><code>count</code> (optional, boolean)</td>
<td>
Instructs <code>/exec</code> to count rows and return this value in message header. Default value is <code>false</code>. There
is slight performance hit for requesting row count.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="param"><code>nm</code> (optional, boolean)</td>
<td>
Skips metadata section of the response when <code>true</code>. When metadata is known and client is paging this flag
should typically be set to <code>true</code> to reduce response size. Default value is <code>false</code> and metadata is
included in the response.
</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>


The following will use `curl` to send a query over http. The result will be sent back over HTTP.

> Note that the `query` must be url-encoded.

```shell script
curl -v \
-G http://localhost:9000/exp \
--data-urlencode "query=select * from mydb;" -d limit=5
```

### Success Response
This is an example of successful query execution response. HTTP status code `200`.

~~~ json
{
   "query":"select timestamp, tempF from weather limit 2;",
   "columns":[
      {
         "name":"timestamp",
         "type":"TIMESTAMP"
      },
      {
         "name":"tempF",
         "type":"INT"
      }
   ],
   "dataset":[
      [
         "2010-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z",
         34
      ],
      [
         "2010-01-01T00:51:00.000000Z",
         34
      ]
   ],
   "count":2
}
~~~


### Error response
Example of error response. HTTP status code `400` is used for query errors and `500` for internal server
errors, which should not normally occur.

~~~ json
{
    "query": "\nselect AccidentIndex, Date, Time2 from 'Accidents0514.csv' limit 10",
    "error": "Invalid column: Time2",
    "position": 29
}
~~~


## /exp - Export Data
Just like `/exec`, `/exp` allows you to pass url-encoded queries.
Instead of a json, the results are returned in tabular form to be saved into a file such as `.csv`

Server responds with HTTP `200` when query execution is successful and `400` when there is error and returns error text. 

### Syntax
`/exp` is HTTP GET request with following query arguments:

<table class="alt tall">
<thead>
<th>Argument</th>
<th>Remarks</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="param"><code>query</code> (required)</td>
<td>
URL-encoded query text. It can be multi-line, but query separator, such as <code>;</code> must not be included.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="param"><code>limit</code> (optional)</td>
<td>
This argument is used for paging. Limit can be either in format of <code>X,Y</code> where <code>X</code> is the lower 
limit and <code>Y</code> is the upper, or just <code>Y</code>. For example, <code>limit=10,20</code> will return row numbers 10 thru to 20 inclusive.
and <code>limit=20</code> will return first 20 rows, which is equivalent to <code>limit=0,20</code>
</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>


### Success response
Below is example of exporting data from command line using `curl`

```shell script
curl -v -G http://localhost:9000/exp \
    --data-urlencode "query=select AccidentIndex2, Date, Time from 'Accidents0514.csv'" \
    -d limit=5
```
